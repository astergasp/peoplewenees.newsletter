      <p> The UN Food Systems Summit happening this September is presented as a 'people’s summit' and a 'solutions summit' that will serve to 'launch bold new actions to deliver progress on all 17 SDGs, each of which relies to
        some degree on healthier, more sustainable and equitable food systems' <i>(UN Food Systems Summit Website)</i>. Yet the summit’s plan, direction and
        participants present us with a profit-centered agenda that puts corporations above people’s rights, small-scale
        farmers’ voices and our climate.</p>
      <p>On the 22nd of April, the People’s Coalition on Food Sovereignty launched a campaign called #Hungry4Change with
        the aim 'to demand food systems which put people’s fundamental rights above profit, our planet over corporations, and our sovereignty over monopolies, people’s movements and civil society organisations'<i> (PCFS website)</i>. </p>
      <p>We used protest statements posted online under the hashtag #TheFoodWeWant to form a manifesto that served as a
        base for this digital fanzine. With it we aim to give more insight and create a better understanding of
        corporate capture in food and agriculture.</p>//

At the very least, these glaze over real systemic solutions that address root causes of the global food crisis – poverty,  inequality, and unsustainability.
